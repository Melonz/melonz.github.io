# Why'd you do this?
Because:

- We're not an **actual** incorporation, we're just a team, so it's wrong to use the word "incorporation".
- "Melonz Development" is a better name than "Melonz, Inc." in my opinion.

# Did I see <b><u>A NEW BANNER???!?</u></b>
Yes, you did, and I think it looks a lot better than our old one. Here's a comparison image:

![OThis one's extremely cluttered, and just tells you what you can already read in our bio.](/img/posts/new_branding/oldbanner.jpg)

# What's your new links?
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/MelonzDev)

[Facebook](https://facebook.com/MelonzDev), etc

# What does this mean for me?
Not much, really, except that our links are slightly different.

# That's it!
Just wanted to keep you guys updated. Stay tuned!
