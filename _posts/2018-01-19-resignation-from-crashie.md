We are officially leaving Crashie today.

# Huh? What's that?

Crashie is a "brand of everything for everyone". They are also "a content creation network. We do not just offer help and assistance to our partners who want to get recognized. We also prominently feature things that our partners have created."

No, I don't like PR speak either.

Basically, they're a network of brands and content creators that's meant to promote each other.

# Where It Falls Apart for Us

Crashie promises that they'll help promote you, and help you grow your channel, brand, or whatever.

The thing is, we have been watching, and we haven't really seen too much growth from Crashie. It's mostly been us.

And this is why, today, we're leaving the Crashie brand.

# Don't Spread Hate

This isn't meant to be a mass "@crashieprod go die". It's meant to serve as an announcement, and an explanation as to why we're leaving.

# And, with that...

This concludes our quick open letter to Crashie and everyone else who follows us. Thank you for sticking with us, and we wish Crashie good luck in the future.
