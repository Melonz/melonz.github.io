# Why?
Well, I'll show you one image that'll explain everything.

![Yeah... Nice and <code>#000</code> black, huh?](/img/posts/new_logo/nice_jpeg.jpg)

If you prefer a proper explaination, here's a list:

- The old logo can only work properly if the site uses circle profile pictures.
- In square JPEGs, as you saw above, the old logo looks **pretty bad**.

# That's all.
